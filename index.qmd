## What is the Education Data Portal? 

* A freely available one-stop-shop for all major datasets released by government agencies on U.S. schools, school districts, and colleges. 
* A tool that bridges the gap between **<span style="color:#1696d2;">data availability</span>** and **<span style="color:#1696d2;">data accessibility</span>** in the education space. 

## What do I mean by the <br> availability-accessibility gap? 

**<span style="color:#1696d2;">Example: Collecting data on COVID in jails and prisons</span>**

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}

* An Excel spreadsheet...  
* Scanned as a PDF... 
* At an angle...
* And a little blurry... 
* With inconsistent rows and columns... 
* And dark text on a dark background... 
* And the occasional coffee spill...  

:::

**<span style="color:#1696d2;">Accessible to whom?</span>**

## How does the portal bridge the availability-accessibility gap?

**How has tuition at my alma mater changed since the 90s?**

**<span style="color:#1696d2;">Without</span>** using the Education Data Portal... 

::: {style="font-size: 60%"}

* Find the agency collecting this data 
* Download data files for each year 
* Read each file into R or Python 
* Read the data documentation to find the right variable 
* Notice a few confusing jumps     
* Re-read the data documentation (and discover that the variable definition changed in the late-90s) 
* ~~Give up~~ Take an ice cream break 
* Update the code to account for the change 
* Set a reminder to repeat the process again next year (and hope nothing changes) 

:::

**<span style="color:#1696d2;">This is tedious, error-prone, and simply not fun.</span>**
